# Scalable Selmer-like Framework for the ABC Conjecture

### A Computational and Structural Approach

Structural and computational analysis of the ABC conjecture via a scalable Selmer-like framework. This repository contains the LaTeX source for the paper, Python code to generate all figures, and the final compiled PDF, detailing the empirical analysis of over 60 million triples and its connection to arithmetic geometry.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to ensure full reproducibility of our research.

-   **/paper**: Contains the full LaTeX source code (`main.tex`) for the research paper (principal / extended version) and the final compiled `main.pdf`.
-   **/paper_foundational**: Recommended location for the companion / foundational version (currently located at `/paper2`).
-   **/paper3**: Contains a third paper focused on the computational framework and its empirical limitations.
-   **/code**: Includes the Python script (`generate_figures.py`) used to create all the figures presented in the paper.
-   **/figures**: Stores the high-resolution PNG images of the figures generated by the script.

## How to Reproduce the Results

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CMT-Research/abc-conjecture-framework.git
    cd abc-conjecture-framework
    ```

2.  **Generate the figures:**
    Ensure you have Python 3 and the required packages.
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib networkx numpy pandas
    python code/generate_figures.py
    ```
    This will populate the `/figures` directory. (If your script requires extra packages, add them to `requirements.txt`.)

3.  **Compile the paper:**
    A full LaTeX distribution (like TeX Live) is required.
    ```bash
    cd paper
    pdflatex main.tex
    bibtex main        # if you have .bib references
    pdflatex main.tex
    pdflatex main.tex  # Run twice to resolve references
    ```
    The final PDF will be generated as `paper/main.pdf`.

## Recommended workflow to add the foundational document (if still pending)

If you want to include the other version and keep naming unambiguous, run these commands (example for Jules):

```bash
# from repo root
mkdir paper_foundational
# Copy the foundational LaTeX files into paper_foundational
cp /ruta/local/foundational/* paper_foundational/
git add paper_foundational
git commit -m "Add foundational companion paper (paper_foundational)"
git push origin main
````

Then update this README (or tell me and I will update it for you).

## Provenance & Validation

The file `data/provenance.csv` records factorization provenance for curated triples.
Fields (columns) include:

- `triple_id` — unique identifier for the triple in our dataset
- `a, b, c` — triple entries
- `q, rho` — computed quality and local complexity metric
- `factor_method` — `exact` / `partial` / `heuristic`
- `factor_tool` — name of tool used (PARI/GP, msieve, yafu, ...)
- `tool_version` — version string for the tool
- `date` — validation or factorization date (UTC)
- `notes` — free-text provenance notes

A validation run over a reproducible sample is stored in `data/validation_results.csv`. Use `tools/generate_provenance_template.py` to create a provenance template from your triples CSV and `tools/validate_sample.py` to run a basic PARI/GP-based validation on a sample.

Example commands:
```bash
python tools/generate_provenance_template.py --input data/all_triples.csv --output data/provenance.csv
python tools/validate_sample.py --input data/samples/sample_100k.csv --output data/validation_results.csv
