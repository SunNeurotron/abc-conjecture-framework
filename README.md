# Scalable Selmer-like Framework for the ABC Conjecture

### A Computational and Structural Approach

Structural and computational analysis of the ABC conjecture via a scalable Selmer-like framework. This repository contains the LaTeX source for the paper, Python code to generate all figures, and the final compiled PDF, detailing the empirical analysis of over 60 million triples and its connection to arithmetic geometry.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to ensure full reproducibility of our research.

-   **/paper**: Contains the full LaTeX source code (`main.tex`) for the research paper and the final compiled `main.pdf`.
-   **/code**: Includes the Python script (`generate_figures.py`) used to create all the figures presented in the paper. This script depends on `matplotlib` and `networkx`.
-   **/figures**: Stores the high-resolution PNG images of the figures generated by the script in the `code` directory.
-   **/data**: (Optional) Links to supplemental data, such as the CSV file with the 241 curated high-quality triples, can be placed here or linked from the appendix.

## How to Reproduce the Results

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tu-usuario-de-github/abc-conjecture-framework.git
    cd abc-conjecture-framework
    ```

2.  **Generate the figures:**
    Ensure you have Python 3, `matplotlib`, and `networkx` installed.
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib networkx
    python code/generate_figures.py
    ```
    This will populate the `/figures` directory with all the visualisations.

3.  **Compile the paper:**
    A full LaTeX distribution (like TeX Live) is required.
    ```bash
    cd paper
    pdflatex main.tex
    pdflatex main.tex  # Run twice to resolve references
    ```
    The final PDF will be generated as `paper/main.pdf`.
