# Scalable Selmer-like Framework for the ABC Conjecture

### A Computational and Structural Approach

Structural and computational analysis of the ABC conjecture via a scalable Selmer-like framework. This repository contains the LaTeX source for the paper, Python code to generate all figures, and the final compiled PDF, detailing the empirical analysis of over 60 million triples and its connection to arithmetic geometry.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to ensure full reproducibility of our research.

-   **/paper**: Contains the full LaTeX source code (`main.tex`) for the primary research paper.
-   **/paper2**: Contains the source for a second, foundational paper. *(Note: This was intended to be renamed to `paper_foundational`, but an environment error prevented this.)*
-   **/paper3**: Contains the source for a third paper focused on the computational framework and its limitations.
-   **/code**: Includes the Python script (`generate_figures.py`) used to create all data and figures.
-   **/figures**: Stores the high-resolution PNG images of the figures generated by the script.
-   **/data**: Intended for CSV datasets generated by the analysis script.

## How to Reproduce the Results

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CMT-Research/abc-conjecture-framework.git
    cd abc-conjecture-framework
    ```

2.  **Generate the data and figures:**
    Ensure you have Python 3 and the required packages (`requirements.txt`).
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python code/generate_figures.py
    ```
    This will generate `data/abc_triples_analysis.csv` and populate the `/figures` directory.

3.  **Compile the papers:**
    A full LaTeX distribution (like TeX Live) is required.
    ```bash
    # For the main paper
    cd paper
    latexmk -pdf main.tex

    # For the foundational paper
    cd ../paper2
    latexmk -pdf main.tex

    # For the computational paper
    cd ../paper3
    latexmk -pdf main.tex
    ```

## Provenance & Validation

The file `data/provenance.csv` (when available) records factorization provenance for curated triples.
Fields (columns) include:

- `triple_id` — unique identifier for the triple in our dataset
- `a, b, c` — triple entries
- `q, rho` — computed quality and local complexity metric
- `factor_method` — `exact` / `partial` / `heuristic`
- `factor_tool` — name of tool used (PARI/GP, msieve, yafu, ...)
- `tool_version` — version string for the tool
- `date` — validation or factorization date (UTC)
- `notes` — free-text provenance notes

A validation run over a reproducible sample is stored in `data/validation_results.csv`. Use `tools/generate_provenance_template.py` to create a provenance template from your triples CSV and `tools/validate_sample.py` to run a basic PARI/GP-based validation on a sample.

Example commands:
```bash
python tools/generate_provenance_template.py --input data/all_triples.csv --output data/provenance.csv
python tools/validate_sample.py --input data/samples/sample_100k.csv --output data/validation_results.csv
````
