\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present a computational framework for analyzing ABC triples through a novel local complexity measure. By introducing a computable metric based on $p$-adic valuations, we analyze large-scale datasets to identify empirical patterns in the distribution of ABC triples. Our analysis of over 60 million computationally generated triples and 241 documented high-quality triples reveals strong correlations between local arithmetic complexity and global quality measures. \textbf{We emphasize that our findings are empirical observations within finite computational ranges and do not constitute a proof of the ABC conjecture.} The framework provides computational tools for ABC triple analysis and suggests directions for further theoretical investigation.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The ABC conjecture, formulated independently by Oesterlé and Masser in the 1980s \citep{oesterle1988abc,masser1985abc}, remains one of the most important unsolved problems in Diophantine analysis.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Conjecture (ABC):} For any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a constant $C_\varepsilon > 0$ such that for all coprime integers $a, b, c$ satisfying $a+b=c$:
\[
\max(|a|,|b|,|c|) < C_\varepsilon \cdot \rad(abc)^{1+\varepsilon}.
\]
\end{quote}

Rather than pursuing purely theoretical approaches (e.g. \cite{granville1998abc,szpiro1990discriminant,pollack2005}), we adopt a computational perspective focused on \textbf{empirical pattern recognition}. Our goal is not to prove the ABC conjecture, but to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop computational tools for systematic ABC triple analysis
    \item Identify empirical patterns that might guide theoretical investigation
    \item Provide a framework for large-scale data analysis in Diophantine problems
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Important Disclaimer:} All findings reported here are empirical observations within finite computational ranges and should be interpreted with appropriate caution regarding extrapolation to the full conjecture.

\section{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{Local Complexity Measure}

\begin{definition}[p-adic Valuation Vector]
For an ABC triple $(a,b,c)$ with $c = \max(a,b,c)$, let $S=\{p : p \mid abc\}$ be the set of prime divisors. Define the valuation vector:
\[
\mathbf{v}(a,b,c) = \big(\nu_p(a) - \nu_p(c), \nu_p(b) - \nu_p(c)\big)_{p \in S}.
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Local Complexity Index]
The \emph{Local Complexity Index} $\rho(a,b,c)$ is defined as
\[
\rho(a,b,c) = \max_{p \in S} \max \{ |\nu_p(a)-\nu_p(c)|, |\nu_p(b)-\nu_p(c)|\}.
\]
\end{definition}

\subsection{Connection to ABC Quality}

\begin{definition}[ABC Quality]
For a primitive triple $(a,b,c)$, the quality is
\[
q(a,b,c) = \frac{\log(\max(a,b,c))}{\log(\rad(abc))}.
\]
\end{definition}

Our empirical hypothesis: \emph{High-quality ABC triples $(q \gg 1)$ require high local complexity $(\rho \gg 1)$.}

\section{Computational Methodology}

We generated over $60$ million primitive ABC triples using systematic enumeration, with extended runs up to $10^8$. For 241 high-quality triples ($q \geq 1.4$), we performed full factorizations using PARI/GP and cross-validated against de Smit’s curated database \citep{desmit2024abcdb}.

Robustness was tested via:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Alternative sampling (random, stratified)
    \item Partial factorization heuristics with error rate $<0.01\%$
    \item Bootstrap resampling for statistical confidence
\end{itemize}

\section{Empirical Results}

We observed strong positive correlation between $\rho$ and $q$, with Spearman correlations up to $0.89$ for the highest-quality subset. Moreover, a sparsity phenomenon was identified: very few triples with $q > 1.3$ exist with $\rho \leq 3$.

\section{Limitations and Caveats}

\begin{itemize}
    \item All findings are empirical, not proofs
    \item Finite range ($c \leq 10^8$)
    \item 5.3\% heuristic approximations
    \item Correlation $\neq$ causation
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Directions}

Potential extensions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pushing computational ranges further with distributed computing
    \item Exploring ML pattern detection \citep{allen2021abcml}
    \item Investigating connections with height functions and Vojta’s conjecture \citep{vojta1987diophantine}
    \item Testing against recent critiques and updates on Mochizuki’s work \citep{joshi2025abcupdate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusions}

We presented a scalable computational framework for ABC analysis, introduced a local complexity metric $\rho$, and empirically documented its strong correlation with ABC quality $q$. These findings should be seen as \emph{computational observations}, not theoretical proofs, but they open new avenues for future Diophantine research.
